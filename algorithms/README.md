## Algorithms

This section contains different algorithms for solving basic problems. As the
challenge is intended to teach algorithm themselves, we will not be using any
built-in methods such as `sort()`, `index()`, etc.

List Of Algorithms are as follows:

### searching

- Binary Search
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Linear Search

### sorting

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

### Greedy Algorithms

- Fractional Knapsack
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Egyptian Fraction
